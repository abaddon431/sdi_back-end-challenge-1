## Car Rental Problem

To run the main solution, type the following commands:
```
python main.py
```
and input a number of seats like this example below:
```
Please input number (seat): 20
```
After providing an input, it should print out the following output:
```
M x 2
Total = PHP 16000
```

## Test Cases
I have written a few test cases for the solution to test other inputs. The test cases are as follows:

```
Input = 20
Size 	Seat Capacity 	Cost (PHP)
Small (S) 	5 	5000
Medium (M) 	10 	8000
Large (L) 	15 	12000
```
Answer = Medium x 2
```
Input = 30
Size 	Seat Capacity 	Cost (PHP)
Small (S) 	5 	5000
Medium (M) 	10 	8000
Large (L) 	15 	12000
```

Answer = Medium x 3

```
Input = 20
Size 	Seat Capacity 	Cost (PHP)
Small (S) 	5 	5000
Medium (M) 	9 	8000
Large (L) 	15 	11000
```
Answer = Small x 4
```
